## About
While most music players provide an option for Internet streaming, you might not always want to run your resource hungry media player.

Radiola is a lightweight Internet radio player for macOS. It's located in the menu bar and allows you to listen to Internet radio stations quickly and without complications.

Most often, you use the **menu in the menu bar**.

In the **station window** you can both manage the station list and use it as an Internet radio player.

The **history** allows you to find out what song is playing now or has played recently.
